### Connecting to a Shared Calendar
- **Outlook for Desktop and OWA**: [Microsoft: User Training - Open another person's Exchange Calendar](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/open-another-person-s-exchange-calendar-2257f515-408f-48ea-9363-11d0d5848c77#ID0EBBD=Microsoft_365)

  - Please Note: When a calendar is shared with a recipient, Outlook will attempt to send an email that will allow the user to connect to the calendar.
    
    - If permissions are changed by a calendar owner at a future time, or the individual already has an active connection to a calendar being re-shared with them in their Outlook client, it is recommended that the recipient remove the prior version of the calendar from their Outlook client to ensure permissions are appropriately updated. Failure to do this can result in users receiving access related errors to the calendar.

## User Calendar Best Practices -  [Microsoft Calendar Best Practices](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/best-practices-for-organizations-when-using-the-outlook-calendar-d93f72d3-2361-4e0d-8d6a-5c4939c17f39)

Effective use of an Outlook Calendar involves following best practices to ensure efficient time management and collaboration.

### Process all meeting requests and cancellations

- Although you can delete a meeting request directly from your Inbox, you should properly process the meeting request by either accepting or declining it. Always use the Remove from Calendar command to process meeting cancellations from your Inbox. Avoid processing meetings directly from the Calendar module. Failure to do this can result in broken event functionality, that both Microsoft and RCIT will be unable to restore, as this is no current Microsoft support in the product for this, at the time of this writing.

- In the event where a calendar meeting becomes "orphaned" from the original organizer, you will need to recreate the event and re-invite all original participants.
  - Prior participants will also need to manually remove the prior version of orphaned meeting manually. 

### Working with recurring meetings

**Set end dates and limit the number of occurrences**

- Outlook makes it easy to schedule a meeting that has multiple regular occurrences. We recommend that you always set an end date and limit the recurring series to a specific number of occurrences. Most likely, recurring meetings will require modifications at some point. For example, attendees will be added to or removed from a single occurrence, or the meeting location or time will change due to vacation dates or unforeseen circumstances. Outlook saves each of these unique changes as a meeting exception. Meetings with a very large number of exceptions result in a meeting series that is difficult to manage. Additionally, it can introduce unexpected behavior. You can always create a new meeting series when the current one ends. When thinking about the number of occurrences, consider the frequency. In the period of a year, a twice weekly meeting will have about 90 more occurrences than a monthly meeting during that same period. 

**End a recurring meeting before the original end date**
  
- Although you can cancel a recurring meeting, a better option is to change the end date for the series. This allows you and the attendees to keep a record of the meetings that occurred in the past. If you cancel the recurring meeting altogether, that history is lost. The best option is to set a new end date and then send the update to all attendees. This ends the meeting series early, while keeping a record of previous meetings.

### Change the organizer

- Outlook does not provide a way to change a meeting organizer. To change the meeting organizer of a recurring meeting, end the recurring meeting. To do this, set an earlier end date and send the update to all attendees. After you complete this step, the new organizer should create a new recurring meeting.

  -For more information about setting an earlier end date, see [Cancel a meeting](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/cancel-a-meeting-9e1eac0d-0462-4a01-ad0b-7d0543819562)

### Avoid using a recurring meeting to share attachments

- Attachments add to the complexity of recurring meeting exceptions. Each exception contains its own copy of the attachments. As exceptions are added to recurring meetings, new copies of the attachments are created. If you make changes to one set of attachments, these changes do not propagate to the other exceptions. If you require that all attendees have the most recent copy of changes for any given meeting, share the documents via a sharing service, such as OneDrive. Enterprise users can take advantage of SharePoint or other shared file server on the network.

  - Note: The actions of adding and removing attachments to standalone, non-recurring meetings are fully supported.
 
### Avoid copying meetings

- By design, Outlook removes any links between a copied meeting and the original meeting. This helps prevent inconsistencies. Newer versions of Outlook add the text string "Copy:" to the subject. This makes it easy to identify meeting copies.
- Actions related to copied meetings yield unexpected results, so we recommend avoiding copying meetings. This applies to both meetings copied from another user's calendar, as well as those copied from another calendar folder that you own.
- For more information about how to move meetings that you organized to another calendar folder, see:

  - How to move Outlook meetings without losing the option to "[Send Update](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/outlook/troubleshoot/calendaring/send-update-missing-copy-meeting)"
  - Please note, RCIT cannot restore events which have been copied, and this should be avoided when possible.

### General Calendar Management
