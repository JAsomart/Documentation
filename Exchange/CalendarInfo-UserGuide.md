### Connecting to a Shared Calendar
- **Outlook for Desktop and OWA**: [Microsoft: User Training - Open another person's Exchange Calendar](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/open-another-person-s-exchange-calendar-2257f515-408f-48ea-9363-11d0d5848c77#ID0EBBD=Microsoft_365)

  - Please Note: When a calendar is shared with a recipient, Outlook will attempt to send an email that will allow the user to connect to the calendar.
    
    - If permissions are changed by the calendar owner at a future time, or the individual already has an active connection to the calendar in their Outlook client, it is recommended that the recipient remove the prior version of the calendar from their Outlook client to ensure permissions are appropriately updated. Failure to do this can result in users receiving access related errors to the calendar.

## Best Practices for Users
Effective use of an Outlook Calendar involves following best practices to ensure efficient time management and collaboration.

### Process all meeting requests and cancellations

- Although you can delete a meeting request directly from your Inbox, you should properly process the meeting request by either accepting or declining it. Always use the Remove from Calendar command to process meeting cancellations from your Inbox. Avoid processing meetings directly from the Calendar module. Failure to do this can result in broken event functionality, that both Microsoft and RCIT will be unable to restore, as this is no current support in the product for this.

- In a sitaution where a calendar event becomes "ophaned" you will need to recreate the event and re-invite/notify all prior participants. Prior participants will also need to manually remove the prior version of the prior orphaned meeting manually.

### Working with recurring meetings

**Set end dates and limit the number of occurrences**

- Outlook makes it easy to schedule a meeting that has multiple regular occurrences. We recommend that you always set an end date and limit the recurring series to a specific number of occurrences. Most likely, recurring meetings will require modifications at some point. For example, attendees will be added to or removed from a single occurrence, or the meeting location or time will change due to vacation dates or unforeseen circumstances. Outlook saves each of these unique changes as a meeting exception. Meetings with a very large number of exceptions result in a meeting series that is difficult to manage. Additionally, it can introduce unexpected behavior. You can always create a new meeting series when the current one ends. When thinking about the number of occurrences, consider the frequency. In the period of a year, a twice weekly meeting will have about 90 more occurrences than a monthly meeting during that same period. 

**End a recurring meeting before the original end date**
  
- Although you can cancel a recurring meeting, a better option is to change the end date for the series. This allows you and the attendees to keep a record of the meetings that occurred in the past. If you cancel the recurring meeting altogether, that history is lost. The best option is to set a new end date and then send the update to all attendees. This ends the meeting series early, while keeping a record of previous meetings.

### Effective Calendar Sharing
- **Selective Sharing:** Share only necessary details of your calendar to maintain privacy and confidentiality. [Calendar Sharing Best Practices](#link-to-microsoft-calendar-sharing-best-practices)
- **Regular Permission Reviews:** Periodically review and adjust who has access to your calendar and their permission levels. [Managing Calendar Permissions](#link-to-microsoft-managing-calendar-permissions)

- **Use of Reminders:** Set reminders for important meetings and tasks to stay organized. [Setting Up Reminders](#link-to-microsoft-setting-up-reminders)
