# In-Depth Guide: Event Creation and Management for Exchange Online (Outlook) User Calendar

## Overview
This guide expands on the "Event Creation and Management" section from the main Exchange Online User Calendar documentation. It provides step-by-step instructions on creating, editing, managing, and importantly, properly deleting events in your Exchange Online Calendar.

## Creating an Event

### Step 1: Accessing Your Calendar
- Open your Outlook application or sign in to [Outlook Web App (OWA)](https://outlook.office.com).
- Navigate to the calendar section.

### Step 2: Adding a New Event
- Click on the desired date and time slot in the calendar.
- Alternatively, click on the "New Event" or "New Meeting" button (varies based on version).

### Step 3: Filling in Event Details
- Enter the **Event Title**.
- Choose the **Start** and **End Time**. If it's an all-day event, select the "All Day" option.
- Add **Location** (physical or virtual).

### Step 4: Adding Participants (Optional)
- Click on "Invite People" and enter the email addresses of participants.
- Use the "Scheduling Assistant" to find suitable times for all attendees.

### Step 5: Setting Reminders
- Choose a reminder time from the drop-down menu.

### Step 6: Saving the Event
- Click "Save" for appointments or "Send" for meetings with attendees.

## Editing an Event

### Step 1: Locating the Event
- Navigate to the event in your calendar.

### Step 2: Making Changes
- Double-click the event to open it.
- Make necessary changes (time, date, participants, etc.).

### Step 3: Saving Changes
- Click "Save" and "Close". If it's a meeting, update the attendees by clicking "Send Update".

## Deleting an Event

### Step 1: Selecting the Event
- Click on the event you wish to delete.

### Step 2: Deleting the Event
- Press the "Delete" key or click on the "Delete" button.

### Step 3: Confirming Deletion
- If itâ€™s a meeting with attendees, choose whether to notify them.

## The Importance of Properly Deleting Events

### Understanding the Impact
- As the organizer of an event, it is crucial to properly delete the event if it is no longer needed. Failing to do so can lead to confusion among attendees and mismanagement of schedules.

### Limitations for IT in Reassigning Events
- It's important to note that if an event becomes "orphaned" (for instance, if the organizer leaves the organization without deleting the event), RCIT typically cannot reassign this event back to the original organizer or another user. This limitation exists because Microsoft does not provide support for reassigning orphaned events in Exchange Online.

### Best Practices
- Always delete events you organize if they are canceled or rescheduled.
- Inform attendees of any changes promptly to avoid confusion.
- Regularly review and clean up your calendar to ensure all events are current and accurate.
- If an individual leaves the organization who was the organizer for various meetings, place a request for delegate access to the users inbox, and cancel (with notification) all events created by the user.

## Managing Time Zones

### Step 1: Creating an Event in a Different Time Zone
- While creating an event, click on the "Time Zone" link next to the start and end time.

### Step 2: Selecting the Time Zone
- Choose the appropriate time zone for the event.

### Step 3: Saving the Event
- Complete the rest of the details and save the event.
