### New Teams is now generally available
We are excited to announce the general availability of new Teams for Windows and Mac users. The new Teams app offers improved performance, enhanced reliability, security, and IT management. It is up to two times faster and uses 50% less memory.

New Teams includes support for multitenant organizations (MTO) and multitenant, multiaccount (MTMA), enabling cross-tenant communication and collaboration. New Teams will be the exclusive platform for new capabilities, features, and enhancements.

### Servicing Agreement
Teams is governed by the Modern Lifecycle Policy. Automatic updates ensure the latest capabilities, performance enhancements, security, and service reliability. An in-app alert is displayed for versions that are one to three months old.
