## Summary: [Microsoft Teams Classic Client End of Availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-classic-client-end-of-availability)
Microsoft Teams Classic Client is approaching product end of life. 

Endpoint devices which have not upgraded from the Microsoft Teams Classic Client to the new modern Teams client, will be required to do so prior to March 31st, 2024. Clients not in compliance will experience a forced update through Microsoft on March 31st, 2024.
The intent of this meeting is to inform all parties of our intent to transition endpoint devices from Microsoft Teams Classic Build to Microsoft Teams Modern Build prior to March 31st, 2024, and of any other work which may need to be completed by RCIT groups.

Using the table of contents above, we have attempted to narrow the scope of several actionable items to specific groups for ease of consumption. Our current Pre-Migration and Migartion Phase timeline dates are subject to change based on the outcome of this meeting.

## Timeline: Expected deployment dates and dates of importance
  
### Pre-Migration Phase
### Assessment and Inventory (Week 1: January 29th through February 2nd)
- Evaluate Customization Requirements: Identify any specific configurations, requirements, or customizations needed in the new Teams version.
- Announce Migration Plan: Inform RCIT staff about the migration timeline and what to expect.
- Teams Warning Banner: Starting on February 1, 2024, any classic Teams users who havenâ€™t updated to new Teams will begin seeing an informational banner to remind them about the timeline for the auto update. This banner will appear in the main Teams client window at the top of the page (underneath the main bar). Note: This notification is enforced and displayed by Microsoft. It can be dismissed, but it cannot be disabled. This will also prompt any time the Teams client is initially run.

### User Communication and Training (Week 2: February 5th through February 9th)

- Schedule Training Sessions: Organize training for the new Microsoft Teams features.
