# What Users Will Experience After March 31, 2024

## Overview
After March 31, 2024, if you’re already running on new Teams, there will be no change in behavior. Your Teams will continue working as expected.

Users on classic Teams will be automatically updated to the new Teams client. Users won’t be able to switch back to classic Teams after this date, because classic Teams won’t be functional. Microsoft will attempt to uninstall classic Teams.

## What Happens If We Can’t Update Users to New Teams
Once classic Teams is no longer available for you, you're going to see a dialog similar to the one below, and classic Teams won't work for you anymore.

![Alt text](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/media/teams-client-eol-notification-box.png)


Teams dialog box that appears after classic Teams no longer works, if you're unable to be updated to the new Teams client. The notification box has a link to requirements and a button that takes you to Teams on the web.

To use Teams after this point, install the new Teams client or use Teams on the web.

If you fall under the June 30, 2024 list items and you aren’t able to be updated at the end of March, your classic Teams client will continue to run until June 30, 2024. There will continue to be a warning banner at the top of your client. We do ask that users update their OS and address any other issues to continue using the Teams client after this time, as new features are only being added to the new Teams client.

## Admin Experience

### What Admins Will See Until March 31, 2024
Admins have full control over their tenant’s transition to new Teams via the Upgrade to the new Teams using policies article.

A bulk installer, including offline capability, is provided for admins who want to deploy new Teams using their own tools and process and use Teams policies to move their users to the desired experience: Bulk upgrade to the new Microsoft Teams client.

Microsoft highly recommends that admins who want more control or a more gradual rollout of new Teams take advantage of these tools and functionality to begin slowly transitioning their users to new Teams now. Policies can be targeted to individual users, groups of users, or your entire tenant to give you flexibility to release to users group by group while monitoring progress and feedback.

### What Admins Will Experience Starting March 31, 2024
Beginning March 31, 2024, all policy options within Teams Admin Center to control the transition to new Teams will be made unavailable or will no longer function for all users.

After these options are removed, Microsoft will begin moving all users except VDI users back to the Microsoft controlled policy setting. After March 31, 2024, the Microsoft controlled policy setting will equate to the user being assigned the New Teams Only policy (this policy option will be released soon). This will allow them to transition the user to new Teams and then uninstall the classic Teams client. Learn more in the Upgrade to the new Teams using policies article.
