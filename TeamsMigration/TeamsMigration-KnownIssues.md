**What features are changing, have reported issues, and are currently unavailible in the Modern Teams Client**

- **Annotations from the Presenter Toolbar**: Currently unavailable.
- **PowerPoint Live Standout**: Not yet available.
- **Language-aware Spell Checking**: Not available in the new Teams. The team is prioritizing this issue. Check back for updates.
- **Spell Checking on Windows**: Limited to English (United States) dictionaries. Users can disable spell checking from the settings page until fixed.
- **Inaccurate Spell Checker Suggestions for English**: A Windows fix is pending, estimated rollout in January. Users can disable spell checking from the settings page until then.
- **Scheduling a Teams Live Event**: Currently redirects to the classic Teams web experience. By late March, it will redirect to the new Teams web experience.
- **Producing a Teams Live Event**: Available in the new Microsoft Teams Desktop client in March. Until then, switch back to classic Teams.
- **User Presence Visibility in 1:1 Chats**: Issue with viewing the presence of other users under the Organization tab. Restarting the new Teams client or browser window may resolve this, but still an issue for offline contacts.
- **Date Time Formats**: New Teams client isn't respecting OS-set formats, affecting 12h/24h time and date formatting. A fix is pending.
- **Missing Features**: Support for NDI, SDI, and ISO streaming of Teams media content; setting presence in taskbar; showing and setting presence in system tray.
- **App Crashes**: Occurs if users hit enter instead of clicking the Create button in the team creation wizard.
- **Visibility of Newly Created Private Channels**: Won't show up in the left rail until the page is reloaded or users navigate away and return.
- **Calendar Icon Error for Unlicensed Users**: Shows an error message for users not licensed with Exchange Online. A fix to hide the icon is expected soon.
- **Missing 'Report a Problem' in Help Menu**: For users in the public preview channel.
- **Cross Cloud Guest Access (CCGA) Accounts**: Not shown on the Web client. Users can use CCGA meeting-join links or navigate to the cloud-specific URL in a new tab.
- **Cross Cloud Meeting (CCM) Link Issues**: If using classic Teams for Web, opening a CCM link into a cloud where the user is opted into new Teams for web will fail. Users may navigate directly to the cloud-specific URL to join their meeting until a fix is ready.
