# User Settings Migration

End user settings are automatically migrated from classic Teams to new Teams during the initial switch.

> **Note**  
> Settings are only migrated once, the first time a user updates to new Teams. After that, no incremental migrations of setting changes will occur if the user switches back and forth between classic and new Teams.
