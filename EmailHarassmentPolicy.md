# Handling Harassment from an External Email Address in Exchange Online

Dealing with harassment from an external email address through Exchange Online as an email administrator:

## 1. Document Incidents
   - Keep a detailed record of harassment incidents (SNOW), including dates, times, and email content.
   - Open eDiscovery case including all instances of the offender as a "participant"
   - Place "In-place hold" on all mailboxes found with emails contained from the participant. Please note, this should not be a "litigation hold" unless specified by Management or Legal Counsel.

## 2. Notify Legal Department
   - Inform user/agency they should contact HR.

## 3. Block the Sender's Address
   - In the Exchange admin center:
     - Go to "Mail flow" > "Rules."
     - Create a rule to block or redirect emails from the harassing address.
     - Save and activate the rule.
     
         - In some cases, blocking the address may not be advised if messages in question may contain content of intent or a threatening nature, or aggrivate sender into further escalation of behavior. This should be discussed with the user and HR. 

## 4. Communicate with Affected Employees
   - Inform them that we will provide forensic copies of all email from the unwanted sender for evidence in the event of escalation to law enforcement, if necissary

## 5. Involve Law Enforcement
   - If harassment escalates, involve law enforcement authorities.
   - Share documented incidents for their investigation.

## 6. Monitor and Review
   - Continuously monitor the situation and review the effectiveness of your measures.
   - Adjust your approach as needed to ensure employee safety and well-being.
